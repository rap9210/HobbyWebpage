        How does it work?
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Before each new NFL season, each person takes their turn drafting players to their team.</li>
        <li>Every week (NFL teams only play 1 game a week) you face off against a different person's team.</li>
        <li>Your team's performance is quantified and adds to your week's total points.</li>
        <li>If you have more points than your opponent that week you win that week.</li>
        <li>The top x amount of teams go to playoffs.</li>
        <li>The team that wins in playoffs wins the league.</li>
    </ul>
