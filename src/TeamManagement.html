    <h3>
        Team Management
    </h3>
    <p>
        Team management is the essence of the game.<br>
        Each team has a limited number of players they can play each week in any given position.<br>
        The goal is to analyze each player's weekly match up and determine which players will likely<br>
        produce more points than the others. Nothing is for certain. Player injuries play a big role each season.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>
        Waivers
    </h3>
    <p>
        The waivers are the players that are not on anyone's team and can be picked up at any time before the <br>
        start of their game that week. Players that are not superstars are very unpredictable and often go un-drafted.<br>
        Keep in eye out for these prospects. They can make or break a season.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>
        Trading
    </h3>
    <p>
        Another way to look to improve your team is to try to trade players with other teams.<br>
        Trading is a good way to improve weaknesses at certain positions. For example: <br><br>
        You may have too many quarterbacks and in dire need for a running back. Look for another team <br>
        that could use a quarterback and can afford to let go of a running back.<br><br>
        Trades should never been one sided. Any strange looking trades can be vetoed by the league to avoid <br>
        cheating/colluding.
    </p>
