        Winners and Losers
    </h3>

    <p>
        Winning and losing is the biggest part of fantasy. Many leagues play for money, others play for fun, but most of
        them play for bragging rights. It's about laying claim to the throne, proclaiming your greatness and be as
        dramatic and overbearing as possible to the rest of the league. Some leagues even have punishments for the team
        that ended up in last place. The punishments usually involve some light public humiliation, all in good fun.
